                <h3>Where is it ?</h3>
                <p>Urubamba (9420 FASL) is in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, a one-hour drive from Cuzco (11152 FASL) in the Andes of Peru. Cuzco is a 45 min flight from Peru’s capital Lima, right in the Pacific coast.<br>
The Sacred Valley is a collection of towns along the Urubamba river. It’s is packed with cool things to do and see, the most famous is MachuPicchu.

            <div class ="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-7 col-lg-7">
                <h3>Flying there</h3>
                <p>To get to the Sacred Valley you have to fly in to Cuzco from Lima. Many airlines have either one stop or direct flights from the US to Lima. A non-stop flight from Atlanta to Lima takes about 6.5 hours.<br>Recommended Lima – Cuzco airlines are <strong>LATAM, TACA (Avianca), LCP</strong> and <strong>Star Peru</strong>.

                <h3>Getting from Cusco to the Sacred Valley</h3>
                <p>Your hotel should be able to set airport pick up for you, if not, we can help you with that (just send us an email).<br> A trip from the Cuzco airport to Urubamba should be between $20 to $30 for a sedan car.<br>Don't rent a car unless you really are into adventure driving.</div>
            </p>
            <div class ="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-7 col-lg-7">
                <h3>Transport and paying for stuff</h3>
                <p>Once in the Valley, it’s easy to set private transportation. For short trips you can also use local moto-taxis (tuk-tuk).<br>
Although you can pay with credit card for most big purchases (hotel, nice meals, fancy shops), it’s better to have cash for the local services (transport, markets). Exchanging dollars to soles is easy and available and about 3.3 soles per dollar.
